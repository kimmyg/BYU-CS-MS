% This document is in the public domain
%
% Options for this class include the following (* indicates default):
%
%   phd (*) -- produce a dissertation
%   ms -- produce a thesis
%
%   electronic -- default official university option, overrides the following:
%                 - equalmargins
%
%   hardcopy -- overrides the following:
%                 - no equalmargins
%                 - twoside
%
%   letterpaper -- ignored, but helpful for the Makefile that I use
%
%   10pt -- 10 point font size
%   11pt -- 11 point font size
%   12pt (*) -- 12 point font size
%
%   lof -- produce a list of figures in the preamble (off)
%   lot -- produce a list of tables in the preamble (off)
%   lol -- produce a list of listings in the preamble (off)
%
%   layout -- show layout lines on the pages, helps with overfull boxes (off)
%   grid -- show a half-inch grid on every page, helps with printing (off)
%   separator -- print an extra instruction page between preamble and body (off)
%
%   twoside (*) -- two-sided output (margins alternate for odd and even pages,
%     blank pages inserted to ensure that chapters begin on the right side of a
%     bound copy, etc.)
%   oneside -- one-sided output (margins are the same on all pages)
%   equalmargins -- make all margins equal - ugly for binding, but compliant
%
%   twosidetoc - start two-sided margins at the TOC instead of the body.  This
%     is sometimes (oddly) required, but be aware that it will make the page
%     numbering seem screwy, e.g., the first four full sheets of paper will
%     have number i-iv (not shown, though), and the next sheets will each have
%     two numbers, one for each side.  I suspect that most people don't look at
%     the roman numerals anyway, but it is a weird requirement.
%
%   openright (*) -- force new chapters to start on an odd page
%   openany -- don't use this, it's ugly
%
%   prettyheadings -- make the section/chapter headings look nice
%   compliantheadings (*) -- make them look ugly, but compliant with standards
%
%   chaptercenter -- center the chapter headings horizontally
%   chapterleft (*) -- place chapter headings on the left
%
%   partmiddle -- Part headers are centered vertically, no other text on page
%   parttop (*) -- Part headers at top of page, other text expected
%
%   duplexprinter -- Ensures that the two-sided portion starts on the right
%     side when printing.  This is not for use in submission, since the best
%     thing to do there is to print everything out one-sided, then take it down
%     to the copy store to have them do the rest.  It does help to save trees
%     when you are printing out copies just to look at them and fiddle with
%     things.
%
%
% EXAMPLES:
%
% The rest is up to you.  To fiddle with margins, use the \settextwidth and
% \setbindingoffset macros, described below.  I suggest that you
% \settextwidth{6.0in} for better-looking output (otherwise you'll get 3/4-inch
% margins after binding, which is sort of weird).  This will depend on the
% opinions of the various dean/coordinator folks, though, so be sure to ask
% them before embarking on a major formatting task.

% The following command fixes my particular printer, which starts 0.03 inches
% too low, shifting the whole page down by that amount.  This shifts the
% document content up so that it comes out right when printed.
%
% Discovering this sort of behavior is best done by specifying the ``grid''
% option in the class parameters above.  It prints a 1/2 inch grid on every
% page.  You can then use a ruler to determine exactly what the printer is
% doing.
%
% Uncomment to shift content up (accounting for printer problems)
%\setlength{\voffset}{-.03in}

% Here we set things up for invisible hyperlinks in the document.  This makes
% the electronic version clickable without changing the way that the document
% prints.  It's useful, but optional.
%
% NOTE: "driverfallback=ps2pdf" chooses ps2pdf in the case of LaTeX and pdftex
% in the case of pdflatex. If you use my LaTeX makefile (at
% http://latex-makefile.googlecode.com/) then pdftex is the default There are
% many other benefits to using the makefile, too.  This option is not always
% available, so use with care.

% To fiddle with the margin settings use the below.  DO NOT change stuff
% directly (like setting \textwidth) - it will break subtle things and you'll
% be tearing your hair out.
%
% For example, if you want 1.5in equal margins, or 2in and 1in margins when
% printing, add the following below:
%
%\setbindingoffset{1.0in}
%\settextwidth{5.5in}
%
% When equalmargins is specified in the class options, the margins will be
% equal at 1.5in each: (8.5 - 5.5) / 2.  When equalmargins is not specified,
% the inner margin will be 2.0 and the outer margin will be 1.0: inner = (8.5 -
% 5.5 - 1.0) / 2 + 1.0 (the 1.0 is the binding offset).
%
% The idea is this: you determine how much space the text is going to take up,
% whether for an electronic document (equalmargins) or not.  You don't want the
% layout shifting around between printed and electronic documents.
%
% So, you specify the text width.  Then, if there is a binding offset (when
% binding your thesis, the binding takes up space - usually 0.5 inches), that
% reduces the visual space on the final printed copy.  So, the *effective*
% margins are calculated by reducing the page size by the binding offset, then
% computing the remaining space and dividing by two.  Adding back in the
% binding offset gives the inner margin.  The outer margin is just what's left.
%
% All of this is done using the geometry package, which should be manipulated
% directly at your peril.  It's best just to use the above macros to manipulate
% your margins.
%
% That said, using the geometry macro to set top and bottom margins, or
% anything else vertical, is perfectly safe and encouraged, e.g.,
%
%\geometry{top=2.0in,bottom=2.0in}
%
% Just don't fiddle with horizontal margins this way.  You have been warned.

\documentabstract{%
Continuation marks are a programming language feature which generalize stack inspection. Despite its usefulness, this feature has not been adopted by languages which rely on stack inspection, e.g., for dynamic security checks. One reason for this neglect may be that continuation marks do not yet enjoy a transformation to the plain $\lambda$-calculus which would allow higher-order languages to provide continuation marks at little cost.

We present a CPS-like transformation from the call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus augmented with continuation marks to the pure call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus. We discuss how this transformation simplifies the construction of compilers which treat continuation marks correctly. We document an iterative, feedback-based approach using Redex. We accompany the transformation with a meaning-preservation theorem.
