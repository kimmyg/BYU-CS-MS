\chapter{Conclusion}

Continuation marks support a bevy of instrumentation tools and advanced language features in a generalized, portable way. Despite their demonstrated utility, they have not yet found their way into most languages. A verified characterization of continuation marks in a pure computational language provides implementors of higher-order languages a correct compiler for continuation marks.
