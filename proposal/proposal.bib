  title={Portable and high-level access to the stack with Continuation Marks},
  author={Clements, J.},
  year={2006},
  school={Northeastern University Boston},
  annotate={Clements introduces the programming language feature continuation marks and motivates their use. He provides an operational semantics vis Ã¢ vis the Scheme interpreter and three concrete applications: an algebraic stepper and a language with security annotations specifically designed to elucidate the behavior of continuation marks in the presence of tail call optimization and demonstrate the feasibility of such optimizations in languages which rely on security annotations already such as C\# and Java.}

  title={Haskell 98 language and libraries: the revised report},
  author={Jones, S.P.},
  year={2003},
  publisher={Cambridge Univ Pr},
  annotate={This report describes the lazy, purely functional language Haskell. It establishes the core language and libraries that the Haskell 98 standard encompasses as well as motivations for and modifications of certain definitions. The author documents the inception of Haskell as a unification of the many similar functional languages existent at the time. Our profit here is realized in the stated goal for Haskell to be a research tool in addition to the other roles it should fill.}

@article{liang2009modular,
  title={Modular Monadic Semantics},
  author={Liang, S. and Hudak, P.},
  year={2009},
  publisher={Citeseer},
  annotate={Liang, et al. motivate the use of monad for semantic specification by exposing the non-modularity of the commonly used denotational approach. They also discuss monad transformers and the effect of monads on semantics-directed compilation. Most important to this work, they discuss the composition of monads modeling many different features including tracing, assignment, lazy evaluation, continuations, and nondeterminism.}

He introduces a simple language with a monadic interpretation and explores its semantics.}

  year={1995},
  publisher={Springer},
  annotate={Wadler motivates monads as a design pattern with the development of programs with exceptions, state, and output. He presents an extremely readable exposition of the complications of enhancing pure computation with effects, discusses the disadvantages of typical solutions, and demonstrates the ease with which monads achieve the enhancement. This is coupled with a healthy dose of of rigor to ensure the solutions presented are correct. He also discusses the application of monads to array transformers and parsers.}
