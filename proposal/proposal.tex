% Options for this class include the following (* indicates default):
%
%   10pt -- 10 point font size
%   11pt -- 11 point font size
%   12pt (*) -- 12 point font size
%
%   ms -- produce a thesis proposal (off)
%   areaexam -- produce a research area overview (off)
%   phd -- produce a dissertation proposal (off)
%   
%   layout -- show layout lines on the pages, helps with overfull boxes (off)
%   grid -- show a half-inch grid on every page, helps with printing (off)


% This command fixes my particular printer, which starts 0.03 inches too low,
% shifting the whole page down by that amount.  This shifts the document
% content up so that it comes out right when printed.
%
% Discovering this sort of behavior is best done by specifying the ``grid''
% option in the class parameters above.  It prints a 1/2 inch grid on every
% page.  You can then use a ruler to determine exactly what the printer is
% doing.
%
% Uncomment to shift content up (accounting for printer problems)
%\setlength{\voffset}{-.03in}

% Here we set things up for invisible hyperlinks in the document.  This makes
% the electronic version clickable without changing the way that the document
% prints.  It's useful, but optional.  Note that if you use pdflatex, you
% should change "ps2pdf" to "pdftex".

% Rewrite the itemize, description, and enumerate environments to have more
